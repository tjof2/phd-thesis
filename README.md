### Abstract
Developments in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) have opened up
new possibilities for time-resolved imaging at the atomic scale. However, rapid
imaging of single atom dynamics brings with it a new set of challenges,
particularly regarding noise and the interaction between the electron beam and
the specimen. This thesis develops a set of analytical tools for capturing
atomic motion and analyzing the dynamic behaviour of materials at the atomic
scale.

Machine learning is increasingly playing an important role in the
analysis of electron microscopy data. In this light, new unsupervised learning tools are
developed here for noise removal under low-dose imaging conditions and for
identifying the motion of surface atoms. The scope for real-time processing and
analysis is also explored, which is of rising importance as electron microscopy
datasets grow in size and complexity.

These advances in image processing and
analysis are combined with computational modelling to uncover new chemical and
physical insights into the motion of atoms adsorbed onto surfaces. Of particular
interest are systems for heterogeneous catalysis, where the catalytic activity
can depend intimately on the atomic environment. The study of Cu atoms on a
graphene oxide support reveals that the atoms undergo anomalous diffusion as a
result of spatial and energetic disorder present in the substrate. The
investigation is extended to examine the structure and stability of small Cu
clusters on graphene oxide, with atomistic modelling used to understand the
significant role played by the substrate. Finally, the analytical methods are
used to study the surface reconstruction of silicon alongside the electron
beam-induced motion of adatoms on the surface.

Taken together, these studies demonstrate the materials insights that can be
obtained with time-resolved STEM imaging, and highlight the importance of
combining state-of-the-art imaging with computational analysis and atomistic
modelling to quantitatively characterize the behaviour of materials with
atomic resolution.
